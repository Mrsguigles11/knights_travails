# knights_travails

This is a project for The Odin Project whereby I will create a function that will determine the minimum amount of moves for a knight chess piece to move from one square on a chess board to another. The chessboard will be represented using a grapph data structure in javascript, and the project is designed to demonstrate skills using this graph data structure.

Skills demonstrated:
 - Javascript
 - Graphs (data structure)
