# knights_travails

This is a project for The Odin Project whereby I will create a function that will determine the minimum amount of moves for a knight chess piece to move from one square on a chess board to another. The chessboard will be represented using a grapph data structure in javascript, and the project is designed to demonstrate skills using this graph data structure.

Skills demonstrated:
 - Javascript
 - Graphs (data structure)

Thoughts:

In creating the project I stumbled upon a solution that didnt use any specific data structures but that worked by searching for the target or the targets child from a square, and if not found by working out the closest child to the target and checking again. It does not use the data structure or search algorithm that the Odin Project were looking for, however the programme works and seems efficient enough. I have also gone back and written a solution using the Breadth First Search algorithm which is the more optimal solution, and have included that answer here.
